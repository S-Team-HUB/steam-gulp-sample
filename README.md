# Gulp Basics [S-Team]

## Installing gulp and http server
This sample requires you to have global installations of [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).

```sh
# Install gulp globally
npm install -g gulp
# Install http-server globally
npm install -g http-server
```

## Run
```sh
# Install the project's node dependencies
npm install
# build
gulp
# run
cd production
http-server -p 3000
```
And you can navigate to [steam-gulp-sample](http://localhost:3000/)
